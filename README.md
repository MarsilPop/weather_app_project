A Weather App build in HTML CSS and JavaScript. 

The current weather data is fetched from an API key from OpenWeatherMap. The App displays weather information like Temperature,  Weather condition, Humidity and Wind Speed according to the city.
The weather info on the website is from a Free API that I get with JavaScript.
In this weather app there is a search box feature where users can enter the city name and get the weather information of the particular city.
